# Algorithmic-Stock-Trading-Strategy
This project is to build algorithmic strategies for a stock trading competition. The portfolio consists of 10 stocks publicly traded in NASDAQ market. All stocks in the portfolio have been traded for at least one year by January 1, 2021. The project works on models and methods that can automatically update trading strategy of the 10-stock portfolio. The performance is evaluated in 2021M8 to 2021M9 (validation period, strategy update is allowed) and would be tested in 2021M10 (test period, with fixed allocation weight without strategy update).
